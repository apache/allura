Upgrade Instructions

  More to come!

General
 * [#8445] Switched all tests from nose to pytest




Version 1.14.0  (September 2022)

Upgrade Instructions

  To install updated dependencies, run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps --upgrade --upgrade-strategy=only-if-needed
  Run: `./rebuild-all.bash` to get new ForgeFiles app available
  Run: `paster ensure_index development.ini` in Allura dir

  If switching from Python 3.6 to 3.7, you will need to make a completely new python virtual environment,
  and run `pip install ...` in it, and then use it to run Allura.

  If using docker, rebuild the allura image and restart containers.

Breaking Changes
 * [#8413] [#8390] drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.6.  Only Python 3.7 is supported in this release.
 * [#8399] In an effort to update the Docker startup steps to make them as
   easy as possible and compatible across as many OS's as possible, the default
   allura-data location has been moved from `/allura-data` to `./allura-data`.
   This will likely break existing Docker deployments. To fix your deployment,
   Either set the LOCAL_SHARED_DATA_ROOT env variable to /allura-data or change
   the value in the local `.env` file (or move your /allura-data to
   ./allura-data).
 * Remove the `force_ssl.logged_in` config option.  It is recommended to use https for
   all visitors, whether logged in or not.
 * [#8438] gravatar integration is disabled by default, for privacy reasons.  If you wish to enable it, add
   `use_gravatar = true` to your .ini file

Version 1.13.0  (May 2021)

This release supports Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.7.
It is the last release planned to support Python 2.

Upgrade Instructions

  To install updated dependencies, run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps --upgrade --upgrade-strategy=only-if-needed
  Run `./rebuild-all.bash` to get new ForgeFeedback app available

  If switching from Python 2 to Python 3, we recommend upgrading to Allura 1.13.0 first
  and then switch Python versions as a separate step.  When switching Python versions, you
  will need to make a completely new python virtual environment using Python 3, and run
  `pip install ...` in it, and then use it to run Allura.

  When running on Python 3, newer versions of Pygments and Pillow can be installed which
  include security fixes within those packages.  The versions specified in requirements.txt
  are older versions so that Python 2 can still be supported.

  If you have customizations or extensions for Allura, you will need to port that code to
  Python 3.

.ini file changes:
  If you have customized development.ini or docker-dev.ini for your own site, you will
  need to remove all the stats references after the "Logging configuration" section.
  Remove it from 2 `keys =` lists, and 1 `handlers =` list, and the whole [handler_stats]
  subsection.

  All `%` will need to be escaped as `%%`, for example in bulk_export_filename.
  `%` in logging configurations at the bottom of the file is ok.

  For python 3, comments on the same line like `foo = 123; comments` are no longer
  allowed.  For example, `override_root = task` needs to be its own line only.

  New configuration options are available.  If you have an existing .ini file, defaults
  will be used automatically, or you can set your own values for: phone.attempts_limit,
  scm.view.max_file_bytes, and scm.download.max_file_bytes
