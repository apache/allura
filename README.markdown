# Apache Allura

[![Build Status](https://builds.apache.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Allura%2FAllura-py3.10&subject=py3.10)](https://builds.apache.org/job/Allura)
[![Build Status](https://builds.apache.org/buildStatus/icon?job=Allura%2FAllura-py3.13&subject=py3.13)](https://builds.apache.org/job/Allura)

Allura is an open source implementation of a software "forge", a web site that manages source code repositories, bug reports, discussions, mailing lists, wiki pages, blogs and more for any number of individual projects.

Allura is written in Python and leverages a great many existing Python packages (see requirements.txt and friends).  It comes with tests which we run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html).  It is extensible in several ways, most importantly via the notion of "tools" based on `allura.app.Application`; but also with [themes, authentication, and various other pluggable-APIs](https://forge-allura.apache.org/docs/extending.html).

## Contribute

Apache Allura is an effort _for_ the community: an open source platform for sharing development.  We think it should be _of_ the community as well. We want to encourage community involvement in development, testing and design.  We do that with a public git repo, a bug tracker, a discussion list and an IRC channel.

Developers interested in hacking on Allura or its components should see `Allura/docs/docs/development/contributing.rst` or <https://forge-allura.apache.org/docs/development/contributing.html>.

You can get in touch with other Allura developers on the developer mailing list ([dev@allura.apache.org](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/allura-dev/)).

To find more documentation, ask a question, file a bug, or contribute a patch, see the links on our website(<https://allura.apache.org/>).  If you're not sure where to start, join the mailing list and ask.
