oauth_1_0:
    description: |
        OAuth 1.0 may be used to authenticate API requests.

        Another option which is simpler in some ways is "bearer tokens":

        A bearer token (aka access token) may be generated at https://forge-allura.apache.org/auth/oauth/ and used
        in an HTTP header like:

        `Authorization: Bearer MY_BEARER_TOKEN`

          or in a URL like

        `?access_token=MY_BEARER_TOKEN`

        To use bearer tokens, choose "Anonymous" security and then use the Authorization header to enter your Bearer token.
    type: OAuth 1.0
    settings:
      requestTokenUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth/request_token
      authorizationUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth/authorize
      tokenCredentialsUri: https://forge-allura.apache.org/rest/oauth/access_token
