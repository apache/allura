      **Endpoints**
      Permissions can be checked at three levels:
      1. **Neighborhood:** `/rest/p/has_access`
      2. **Project:** `/rest/p/project_name/has_access`
      3. **Tool:** `/rest/p/project_name/mount_point/has_access`

      ---

      It is only available to users that have 'admin' permission for corresponding neighborhood/project/tool. It requires user and perm parameters and will return JSON dict with result key, which contains boolean value, indicating if given user has perm permission to the neighborhood/project/tool.

      E.g.:
      **GET** `/rest/p/test/wiki/has_access?user=admin1&perm=create`
      *returns* { result: true }
      **GET** `/rest/p/test/wiki/has_access?user=user01&perm=create`
      *returns* { result: false }

    queryParameters:
      user:
        type: string
        example: heiths
        required: true
